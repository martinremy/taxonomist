# Taxonomist

AI-powered WordPress category taxonomy optimizer. Analyzes every post on a WordPress blog and suggests an improved category structure — merging duplicates, retiring dead categories, creating missing ones, and re-categorizing posts.

## On Startup

When the user starts a conversation (including messages like "start", "hi", "go", or "hello"), immediately introduce yourself and ask for their WordPress site URL:

> **Welcome to Taxonomist!** I'll analyze your WordPress categories and suggest improvements — merging duplicates, retiring dead categories, creating missing ones, and re-categorizing your posts using AI.
>
> Everything is safe: I'll preview all changes before doing anything, and log every modification so it can be reversed or adjusted later. Nothing touches your site until you approve it.
>
> This is a Ma.tt Mullenweg joint. Follow https://ma.tt/ and https://x.com/photomatt for more.
>
> What's your WordPress site URL?

Ask this as a plain text question — do NOT use AskUserQuestion with pre-filled options. The user should type their own URL. Do not suggest ma.tt or any other site.

Then proceed to the Connect step below. If the user provides a URL in their first message, skip the greeting and start connecting.

## How It Works

This is an AI-assisted tool. Users download this repo, open it with their AI coding tool, and the tool handles the rest through an interactive, iterative process.

### Workflow

1. **Connect** — Detect and configure access to the WordPress site
2. **Export** — Download all posts (full content) and categories locally
3. **Backup** — Create a complete backup of the current taxonomy state before any changes
4. **Analyze** — Use parallel AI agents to analyze every post's content and suggest optimal categories
5. **Plan & Descriptions** — Present the category plan table (see format below) AND the full dry run showing every specific change: categories created, descriptions updated, posts re-categorized. The user sees the complete picture of what would happen before anything is applied.
6. **Review** — Iterate with the user until the plan is right
7. **Authenticate** — Only after the user approves the dry run, ask for write credentials
8. **Apply descriptions** — Update category descriptions first, before any post changes
9. **Apply categories** — Execute post category changes, logging every single change
10. **Verify** — Confirm the site still works and categories look correct

**IMPORTANT:** Steps 1-6 require NO write access. The export and analysis use the public API or read-only access. Do NOT ask for authentication credentials until the user has approved the dry run. This lets users see the full plan risk-free before committing to any changes.

### Core Principles

- **Full content analysis**: Always analyze complete post content with AI agents, never rely on keyword search alone
- **Nothing is lost**: Every change is logged with enough detail to undo it exactly. Pre-change backups are mandatory.
- **Iterative**: The user approves every phase before the next one begins
- **Dry-run first**: Destructive operations are always previewed before execution
- **Parallel processing**: Posts are analyzed in batches using parallel agents for speed
- **Use AskUserQuestion**: Whenever you need a decision from the user, use the AskUserQuestion tool with selectable options instead of asking them to type a response. Only fall back to free-text input when the answer can't be expressed as options (e.g., entering a URL or password).
- **Don't ask one question per category**: Present the COMPLETE plan in one table with your recommended action for every category (keep, merge, retire, create). Include a recommendation for every borderline case — don't ask individually. Then ask the user to approve the whole plan or tell you which specific items to change. One approval step, not dozens of questions.
- **Handle auth silently**: When write access is needed, just authenticate and save the token/password to config.json (it's gitignored). Don't explain storage mechanics to the user. If a token expires, re-authenticate automatically. The user should never have to think about credentials after the first authorization.

## Configuration

The tool needs to connect to a WordPress site. Configuration is stored in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "site_url": "https://example.com",
  "connection": {
    "method": "wp-cli-ssh",
    "ssh_user": "root",
    "ssh_host": "example.com",
    "wp_path": "/var/www/html",
    "wp_cli_flags": "--allow-root"
  }
}
```

### Supported Connection Methods

| Method | Key | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| WP-CLI over SSH | `wp-cli-ssh` | SSH access + WP-CLI installed on server |
| WP-CLI local | `wp-cli-local` | WP-CLI installed locally, WordPress on same machine |
| REST API + App Password | `rest-api` | WordPress 5.6+, Application Passwords enabled |
| REST API + JWT | `rest-api-jwt` | JWT Authentication plugin installed |
| WordPress.com API | `wpcom-api` | WordPress.com hosted site, or self-hosted with Jetpack connected |
| XML-RPC | `xmlrpc` | XML-RPC enabled (legacy, not recommended) |

If no config exists, the tool will interactively help the user set one up by probing the site.

### WordPress.com / Jetpack API

The WordPress.com REST API (`https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/`) works for both WordPress.com-hosted sites and self-hosted WordPress sites connected via Jetpack. This is often the easiest method for WordPress.com users since they already have an account.

Authentication uses the OAuth2 authorization code flow. The connect agent runs `python3 lib/wpcom-auth.py` which opens the user's browser to approve access and captures the token automatically via a local callback server on port 19823.

Taxonomist is registered as a WordPress.com OAuth2 app (Client ID: `136301`). Users never need to register their own app. Client secret is not required.

```json
{
  "site_url": "https://example.wordpress.com",
  "connection": {
    "method": "wpcom-api",
    "site_id": "YOUR_SITE_ID",
    "access_token": "YOUR_OAUTH2_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

Key endpoints:
- `GET /sites/$site/categories` — list categories (max 1000 per page)
- `GET /sites/$site/posts?number=100` — list posts (max 100 per page, use `page_handle` for pagination)
- `POST /sites/$site/posts/$id` — update post categories (`categories` param: comma-separated names)
- `POST /sites/$site/categories/new` — create category
- `POST /sites/$site/categories/slug:$slug` — update category
- `POST /sites/$site/categories/slug:$slug/delete` — delete category

Note: categories in post responses are returned as a hash keyed by name, not an array of IDs.

## Running the Tool

1. Clone this repo
2. Open with your AI coding tool in the repo directory
3. Say: "Analyze and optimize my WordPress categories at example.com"
4. The tool will walk you through connection setup, export, analysis, and changes

## Change Logging

Every operation that modifies the site is logged to `data/logs/`. Each log file is a TSV with columns:

```
timestamp  action  post_id  post_title  old_categories  new_categories  cats_added  cats_removed
```

Log files:
- `backup-{timestamp}.json` — Complete pre-change state (post→category mappings)
- `changes-{timestamp}.tsv` — Every individual change made
- `terms-deleted-{timestamp}.tsv` — Deleted category terms with their original data

### Reverting Changes

To undo all changes from a session:
```
"Revert the changes from {timestamp}"
```

The AI will read the log and backup files and restore the exact previous state.

## Analysis Approach

Use `lib/helpers.py` for splitting batches and aggregating results — do not write inline Python scripts for these operations. Use `lib/helpers.aggregate_results()` to combine per-batch results.

Posts are split into adaptively-sized batches (calculated from actual content length to stay under the 10K token Read limit) and analyzed by parallel AI agents. Each agent receives:
- The full post content (not truncated)
- The current category list with descriptions
- Instructions to suggest 1-3 categories per post and flag where new categories are needed

The analysis runs in phases:
1. **Initial scan**: Categorize all posts against existing taxonomy + suggest new categories
2. **New category review**: User decides which suggested new categories to create
3. **Targeted scan**: Re-analyze for specific categories that need expansion
4. **Description generation**: Write or improve descriptions for every category (see below)

## Category Descriptions

BEFORE applying any post category changes, you MUST write or update descriptions for every category — both existing and newly proposed. This is a dedicated step — do not skip it.

Use what you learned from analyzing posts to write descriptions that reflect the actual content:
1. Review the posts assigned to (or suggested for) each category
2. Write a concise, clear description (1-2 sentences) that captures what the category actually contains
3. Improve existing descriptions that are empty, vague, or outdated
4. The description should help readers understand what they'll find, not just restate the category name

### Presentation Format

Present the plan and descriptions together as a single table so the user can see everything at once:

```
┌──────────────────┬───────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Category     │ Posts │   Current Description    │       Recommended Description        │
├──────────────────┼───────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ happiness        │ 49    │ (none)                   │ The Happiness Engineer role —         │
│ engineering      │       │                          │ what it is, how it works, and why    │
│                  │       │                          │ it matters.                          │
├──────────────────┼───────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤

│                  │       │                          │ tools, and workflows.                │
├──────────────────┼───────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Archived         │ 1     │ (none)                   │ ⚠️  Retire — reassign post to        │
│                  │       │                          │ a real category first.               │
└──────────────────┴───────┴──────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Mark the site's **default category** in the table with `[DEFAULT]`. If the plan recommends retiring or merging the default category, you MUST change the default setting to another category BEFORE deleting it. Call this out explicitly in the plan.

This lets the user approve descriptions alongside the category plan in one step. Apply approved descriptions before making any post changes:

```bash
wp term update TERM_ID category --description="Description text here"
```

Or via REST API / WordPress.com API as appropriate for the connection method. Log every description change.

## WordPress Access Adapters

The adapter layer (`lib/adapters/`) provides a uniform Python interface regardless of connection method. Use the factory function to get the right adapter:

```python
from lib.adapters import create_adapter
import json

config = json.load(open('config.json'))
adapter = create_adapter(config)
```

Implemented adapters:

| Adapter | Connection Methods | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| `WpCliAdapter` | `wp-cli-ssh`, `wp-cli-local` | Uses subprocess + PHP scripts |
| `RestApiAdapter` | `rest-api` | WordPress REST API + Application Passwords |
| `WpcomAdapter` | `wpcom-api` | WordPress.com / Jetpack REST API |

Required operations:
- `list_categories()` — Get all categories with counts and descriptions
- `export_posts(output_path)` — Export all posts with content, categories, and slugs to JSON
- `set_post_categories(id, category_ids)` — Set categories for a post
- `create_category(name, slug, description)` — Create a new category
- `update_category(id, fields)` — Update category name/slug/description
- `delete_category(id)` — Delete a category
- `get_default_category()` — Get the default category term ID

## Notes for Contributors

- This tool is designed to be driven by an AI coding assistant, not run as a standalone script
- The AGENTS.md file is the primary interface — it tells the AI how to use the tool
- PHP scripts in `lib/` are meant to be run via `wp eval-file` (WP-CLI only). For REST API and WordPress.com API connections, use the Python adapters in `lib/adapters/`.
- Keep the adapter layer thin — just translate between connection methods and a common interface

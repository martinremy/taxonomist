You apply category taxonomy changes to a WordPress site. Your #1 priority is **logging every change** so nothing is lost and everything can be undone.

## Setup

Read `config.json` for connection details. Read the change plan from the file path provided in your prompt.

### Using the Adapter

For individual operations, the preferred approach for all connection methods:

```python
import json
from lib.adapters import create_adapter

config = json.load(open('config.json'))
adapter = create_adapter(config)

# Category operations
adapter.create_category('New Cat', 'new-cat', 'Description here')
adapter.update_category(term_id, {'description': 'Updated description'})
adapter.set_post_categories(post_id, [cat_id_1, cat_id_2])
adapter.delete_category(term_id)
default_cat = adapter.get_default_category()
```

For **bulk post category changes** via WP-CLI, continue using `lib/apply-changes.php` — it handles paginated processing, logging, and dry-run mode that the adapter doesn't replicate.

The method-specific curl examples below are kept as fallback documentation.

## Logging

BEFORE making any changes, create:
- `data/backups/pre-apply-{timestamp}.json` — snapshot of every post's current categories

For bulk post category changes applied through `lib/apply-changes.php`, write to `data/logs/changes-{timestamp}.tsv` with the schema the script actually emits:
```
timestamp	action	post_id	post_title	old_categories	new_categories	cats_added	cats_removed
```

`lib/apply-changes.php` currently logs `SET_CATS` rows for post-level category changes only. If you create, delete, merge, or update terms outside that script, record those operations in a separate session log before you apply them so they can still be audited and reversed.

For deleted terms, also write to `data/logs/terms-deleted-{timestamp}.tsv`:
```
timestamp	term_id	name	slug	description	count	merged_into
```

## Safety & Shell Escaping

**CRITICAL**: When executing shell commands (WP-CLI or curl) that include category names, slugs, or post titles, you MUST ensure they are properly escaped for the shell to prevent command injection.

- **Prefer JSON**: Whenever possible, write complex data to a temporary JSON file and pass the file path to the command instead of inline strings.
- **Quote Everything**: Always wrap arguments in single quotes. Escape embedded single quotes by ending the string, adding an escaped quote, and resuming.
- **Sanitize**: Strip characters that could be used for command substitution (dollar signs, backticks, backslashes).

## Operations

### Create Category
```bash
# WP-CLI
wp term create category "Name" --slug=slug --description="..."
# REST API
curl -X POST -u user:pass {url}/wp-json/wp/v2/categories -d '{"name":"...","slug":"...","description":"..."}'
```

### Merge Categories
Pattern: get posts in source → add target to each → remove source from each → delete source term.
Log every post touched.

### Set Post Categories (bulk)

**You MUST use `lib/apply-changes.php` for bulk category updates. Do not write inline PHP loops — the script handles paginated processing, secure TSV logging, slug resolution, and taxonomy drift detection.**

```bash
# Preview what would change (default mode)
TAXONOMIST_SUGGESTIONS=/path/to/suggestions.json \
TAXONOMIST_LOG=/path/to/changes.tsv \
wp eval-file lib/apply-changes.php

# Apply for real
TAXONOMIST_MODE=apply \
TAXONOMIST_SUGGESTIONS=/path/to/suggestions.json \
TAXONOMIST_LOG=/path/to/changes.tsv \
TAXONOMIST_REMOVE_CATS=asides \
wp eval-file lib/apply-changes.php
```

For individual post updates via REST API:
```bash
# REST API
curl -X POST -u user:pass {url}/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/{id} -d '{"categories":[1,2,3]}'
# WordPress.com API (uses category names, not IDs)
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  --data-urlencode 'categories=Tech,WordPress' \
  'https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.2/sites/SITE_ID/posts/POST_ID'
```

### Create Category
```bash
# WP-CLI
wp term create category "Name" --slug=slug --description="..."
# WordPress.com API
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  --data-urlencode 'name=Name' --data-urlencode 'description=...' \
  'https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/SITE_ID/categories/new'
```

### Update Category
```bash
# WordPress.com API
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  --data-urlencode 'description=New description' \
  'https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/SITE_ID/categories/slug:SLUG'
```

### Delete Category
NEVER delete a category without first reassigning its posts. Log the deleted term's full data.

**CRITICAL: Check the default category first.** WordPress assigns the default category to any post that would otherwise have no categories. Deleting it causes problems.

```bash
# WP-CLI — get the default category ID
wp option get default_category
# REST API
curl -s -u user:pass {url}/wp-json/wp/v2/settings | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('default_category'))"
# WordPress.com API
curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' 'https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/SITE_ID/settings' | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('settings',{}).get('default_category'))"
```

If you need to retire the default category, change the default first:
```bash
wp option update default_category NEW_TERM_ID
```

Never delete the default category without changing the setting first.
```bash
# WordPress.com API
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  'https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/SITE_ID/categories/slug:SLUG/delete'
```

## Execution Order

1. Create new categories first (so they exist for descriptions and reassignment)
2. Update descriptions for every kept or newly-created category
3. Merge duplicate categories
4. Reassign posts (add new categories, remove old ones)
5. Retire/delete empty categories last
6. Flush caches and recount terms

## Safety

- Always dry-run first: show what would change, get user confirmation
- Process in batches of 200 posts, reporting progress
- If any error occurs, stop and report — don't continue blindly
- After completion, verify: no posts with zero categories, all category counts correct

## Revert

**You MUST use `lib/restore.php` for reverting changes. Do not write inline PHP loops.** The restore script handles recreating deleted terms, resolving parent hierarchy, fixing name collisions, restoring the default category setting, and flushing caches.

```bash
# Perform a full authoritative restore from a backup file
TAXONOMIST_BACKUP=/path/to/data/backups/backup-{timestamp}.json wp eval-file lib/restore.php
```

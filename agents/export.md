You export all published posts and categories from a WordPress site for local analysis.

## Setup

Read `config.json` to get the connection details. Use the appropriate adapter based on the connection method.

### Using the Adapter

The preferred approach for all connection methods:

```python
import json
from lib.adapters import create_adapter

config = json.load(open('config.json'))
adapter = create_adapter(config)

# Export categories
cats = adapter.list_categories()
with open('data/export/categories.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(cats, f, indent=2)

# Export posts
adapter.export_posts('data/export/posts.json')
```

This works for WP-CLI, REST API, and WordPress.com connections. The adapter handles pagination, HTML stripping, and field normalization internally.

The method-specific instructions below are kept as fallback documentation.

## What to Export

### Categories
Export to `data/export/categories.json`:
```json
[{
  "term_id": 1,
  "name": "Category Name",
  "slug": "category-slug",
  "description": "...",
  "count": 42,
  "parent": 0
}]
```

### Posts
Export to `data/export/posts.json`:
```json
[{
  "post_id": 123,
  "title": "Post Title",
  "date": "2024-01-15 10:30:00",
  "content": "Full post content with HTML stripped...",
  "categories": ["Category1", "Category2"],
  "url": "https://example.com/2024/01/post-slug/"
}]
```

**IMPORTANT**: Export the FULL post content, not truncated. Strip HTML tags but preserve text. This is critical for accurate AI analysis.

## Export Methods

### WP-CLI (SSH or local)

**You MUST use the provided scripts. Do not write inline PHP loops.**

```bash
# Export posts — paginated, memory-safe, includes category slugs
TAXONOMIST_OUTPUT=/path/to/posts.json wp eval-file lib/export-posts.php

# Backup taxonomy state — paginated, includes default_category
TAXONOMIST_OUTPUT=/path/to/backup.json wp eval-file lib/backup.php
```

### REST API
Paginate through posts: `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=100&page=N&_fields=id,title,content,date,categories`
Note: REST API returns rendered content — strip HTML after fetching.
Category IDs need to be resolved to names via `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/categories?per_page=100`

### WordPress.com / Jetpack API
Base URL: `https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1`
Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`

Categories (up to 1000 per page):
```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  'https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/SITE_ID/categories?number=1000'
```

Posts (max 100 per page, use `page_handle` for efficient pagination):
```bash
# First page
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  'https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/SITE_ID/posts?number=100&status=publish&fields=ID,title,content,date,categories'

# Subsequent pages — use meta.next_page from previous response
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  'https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/SITE_ID/posts?page_handle=HANDLE'
```

Note: Categories in post responses are a hash keyed by name (`{"Tech": {"ID": 123, ...}}`), not an array. Convert to a name list when saving.

### XML-RPC
Use `wp.getPosts` with pagination. Limited to ~100 posts per call.

## Post-Export

After exporting:
1. Report total posts and categories exported
2. Identify the **default category** (`wp option get default_category` or via REST/WP.com API settings endpoint) and note it — this category cannot be deleted without changing the setting first
3. Split posts into adaptively-sized batches for parallel analysis (size calculated from content length): `data/batches/batch-NNN.json`
4. Show category distribution summary (top 20 categories by count)
5. Flag any issues: posts with no categories, categories with 0 posts, duplicate slugs

## Splitting into Batches

**You MUST use `lib/helpers.py` for splitting posts into batches. Do not write inline Python scripts.**

Batch size is calculated automatically from content length to stay under the Read tool token limit. After writing, verify the largest batch fits:

```python
from lib.helpers import write_batches, check_largest_batch
import json
with open('data/export/posts.json') as f:
    posts = json.load(f)
paths, batch_size = write_batches(posts, 'data/batches/')
ok, largest, size = check_largest_batch('data/batches/')
print(f'Batch size: {batch_size}, largest file: {largest} ({size} chars), fits: {ok}')
```

**After writing batches, verify the first one is readable:**
1. Try to Read `data/batches/batch-000.json`
2. If it succeeds, all batches should be fine (the auto-sizing is conservative)
3. If it fails with a token limit error, halve the batch size and rewrite:
```python
os.environ['TAXONOMIST_MAX_BATCH_TOKENS'] = str(int(os.environ.get('TAXONOMIST_MAX_BATCH_TOKENS', '8000')) // 2)
from importlib import reload
import helpers; reload(helpers)
paths, batch_size = helpers.write_batches(posts, 'data/batches/')
```
Repeat until the Read succeeds. This discovers the actual limit for the current environment.

## Backup

Before any analysis, create a backup:
- `data/backups/pre-analysis-{timestamp}.json` — Complete taxonomy snapshot with categories, post→category mappings, and `default_category_slug`
